# Unit-2-1st-Attempt
This is my second coding project so pardon my lack of neat and concise code blocks. 

The script.js file breaks down the html list of students into groups of ten, regardless of how big the list is, 
and adds buttons to the bottom of the list to correlate with the number of pages it took to separate the students into tens. 
For example, if there are 54 students on the list, there will be 6 buttons, numbered 1-6, at the bottom to easily browse through all students. 

The button belonging to the page on which the user is currently will be highlighted in blue.
